                    <ul>
                        <li>To-Do List project is an application specially built to keep track of errands or tasks that need
                            to be done.

                    <li>
                        We have provided own customized shell to interact with the Database Management System.

                            It provide readymade implementation of all fundamental operation as well as advanced
                            operation on linear, non linear data structure in an object oriented way.
                        </li>
                        <li>We provide generic way of implementation so we use the functionality for any type of data
